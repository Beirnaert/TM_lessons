This makes sense, as no operation can take place on string typed variables. Before we go any further, it might be interesting to encode certain variables to for example booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first metric we see is *'count'*. This simply states how many observations we have for each variable. We see that all variables have got 800 observations. This is a good sign. Should there be any variable with less observations than the other variable, we're working with missing observations. There are multiple ways to solve this. First of all, one should then go looking for the missing variables, and see whether there is some information we can obtain from them. Once that is done, one of following two solutions should be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The observations with missing variables should be omitted\n",
    "* The missing values should be filled in (in a meaningfull matter)\n",
    "\n",
    "One can already see that this might be difficult. In this course, we'll always opt for the first soltution unless it is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we can also observe a minimum and maximum vale for each variable. This already indicates the range of each variable. For example: the attack value of each pokemon lies somewhere between 5 and 190. This once again makes sense, however in other datasets we might here encounter unlogical values. Such as a negative attack. These observations then once again need to be filtered out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem! This first step already requires common sense and/or some form of knowledge of the data to avoid working with crappy/wrong data. "
